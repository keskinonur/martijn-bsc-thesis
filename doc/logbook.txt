Got the Parrot ARdrone in my hands for the first time.
Starting up by plugging in the battery. Has wifi network (ssid=ardrone_078849)
without encryption. Connected, has:
- ftp (anonymous rw permissions in /data/video/) on 21
- telnet on 20
Has linux with busybox, some scripts available, searching for control scripts..

Using java program ARDrone i could send AT signals to port 5556. After starting
program.elf while in directory /data/video, things happen and sending a signal
gives some message. New version accepts function keys (PgUp starts flying, arrows
for navigating). It seems as if the ARDrone flies back if you push him to another
place in the room.

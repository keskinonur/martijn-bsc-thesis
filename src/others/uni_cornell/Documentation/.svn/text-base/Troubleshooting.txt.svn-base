Joystick/Gamepad does not work:
   
   The software is probably set up to read from a different joystick.
   To get a list of joysticks on the system type 'ls /dev/input/' into
   a terminal.  Joysticks will be named 'js0', 'js1', and so on.  Some
   laptops' accelorometers/accessories appear as joysticks, so which
   one is the game pad may be unclear.  To test a gamepad, install
   jstest ('sudo apt-get install joystick'), and run it ('jstest
   /dev/input/js#', where # is the # of the joystick, exit using
   Ctrl-C).  Once you have found out which joystick is the correct
   one, modify 'gamepad.h' at the line: '#define GAMEPAD_OS_ID "js0"'
   for your proper joystick id, and recompile.


Cannot Connect to Drone:

   The Drones are programmed to pair with one computer at a time.  If
   the drone is not paired with your computer, then it will not assign
   your computer the proper IP address.  To unpair the drone, power up
   the drone, and press the unpair button on the bottom.  Once the
   lights begin flashing, connect your computer's wifi to the drone,
   which will pair your computer to the drone and it should work
   properly now.  Instructional video for repairing:

Help! I'm stuck!

  1) Carefully read ../Quickstart.txt - It has a lot of information
     crammed into it.
  2) Look though the files in 'Documentation'.
  3) Read the Comments in ./application/Sources/UI/planner.cpp
  4) If your still stuck, contact Cooper Bills <csb88@cornell.edu>
